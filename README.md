Code challenge for Cardinal Financial interview process

## Explanation

I decided to use Vue.js, which I am not very familiar with, so I would be further challenged by this exercise. In the end, it turns out I still have yet to fully grasp Vue's data binding and component communication, among other things. This resulted in an incomplete code challenge. Nevertheless, I learned a substantial amount along the way and I'm satisfied with my efforts.

At the time of this edit, it's almost 5am on Friday 12/11/20. I'm going to bed and I'll pick this back up in a few hours to see if I can figure it out. If I can't figure it out before noon, then I'll be submitting an incomplete code challenge. Either way, I fully intend to complete the challenge, regardless of when I submit it.
